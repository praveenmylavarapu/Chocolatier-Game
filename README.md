#Chocolatier – Business simulation game

##Theme:
The basic theme of this game is to do chocolate business by buying raw materials, manufacturing chocolates and selling those for higher profits. Player will be given some amount at the starting of the game as investment. He should increase that amount as much as possible and repay that with interest. Player can manufacture a chocolate only if he knows the recipe of that chocolate and have enough money for manufacturing. Profits will be depending on the recipe used. The tastier the chocolate is, the more number of people buy it. So, more demand for it and high selling price is obtained. Taste depends on the combination of ingredients used. One can buy new recipes or can create their own. Prices of raw materials will vary time to time depending on the season and many other factors. Demand for chocolates also varies. On proper planning of demand and supply, he should be able to buy ingredients for low rate and sell chocolates for higher prices. Any number of players can play this game by creating account. Their progress will be continued as all the details will be stored in files. When the user plays without using strategy, he might end up in a situation where he doesn’t have any money to manufacture chocolates or buy raw materials. For example, if he buys only one ingredient with all his money, he can’t manufacture any chocolates with that single ingredient. In this kind of situations, the game ends.



This package is inspired from a 2007 super hit game, Chocolatier Decadence by Design developed by Big Splash Games LLC.




##Game:




There will be an admin control which can only be accessed by me where I can add new ingredients, new recipes and all.
For the player, when the game starts, these options are displayed in the menu:

*	Chocolate factory
*	Chocolate Shop
*	Market
*	My Status
*	Exit

Chocolate factory is where player manufactures chocolates and create recipes.


The manufactured chocolates are to be sold in chocolate shop.


The ingredients with which chocolates are manufactured are to be brought in the market


In My status section, we can see our status, i.e. – our money, ingredients, chocolates we have and all.


This interface is just a plan for what I want my game to look like. The final game due to improvements might be different from this. However, the concept will be the same.
